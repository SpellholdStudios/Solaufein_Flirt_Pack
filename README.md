## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod is an add-on to one of (perhaps the) first NPC mods for BG2 designed using WeiDU. It adds flirting technology to the Weimer's excellent Solaufein Romance Mod, who shipped without this ability. This should create more enjoyable out of this legendary NPC mod!

For the original Solaufein Romance Mod, which includes all of his background information as Wes originally created it, please visit www.weidu.org. For the original Flirt Pack idea, please visit the Solaufein Forum at www.pocketplane.net.


:warning: **Warning: This mod is rated NC17** :innocent:


<details><summary>Original note from the author</summary>
<p>

###### You know you want it! You know that you have been waiting for it! You have been playing the mod for what seems like forever and still you crave more!! Well, now you can have it! Finally, at long last, the Solaufein Flirt Pack is on its way to completion! Based upon Westley Weimer’s brilliant Solaufein mod, which allowed Baldur’s Gate players to have the Drow elf join their party, this pack is a compilation of the works and ideas of many writers, modders and players, and is an effort to finally complete the flirt pack that was started so long ago. It is being designed to expand upon Weimer’s original romance, without losing the original personality of the character. With the creation of this pack, you will be able to grow closer to the dark elf than you ever have before. You will help Solaufein deal with his decision to leave the Underdark, and find a place for himself on the surface. There will be trials and errors as he learns how to interact in a society that views his kind with anger and mistrust, and you will help him to open up as he explores his new home. The two of you will share an intimacy that you always knew was there… This mod is in progress, but the current feature list includes: - PC to Sola initiated flirts (being coded) - Sola to PC initiated flirts (writing in progress) - More banters with other NPCs (planning stage) - Option to continue romance without sleeping with Sola (planning stage) For more information and progress reports on the mod, or if you wish to contribute, please visit the Solaufein forum here.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

Solaufein Flirt Pack is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/60737-super-firkraag-updated-to-v16-ee-compatible/">report them on the forum</a>!

>Although it is not required for the Solaufein Flirt Pack mod to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-rpgsolaflirtpack.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **rpgsolaflirtpack** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

Solaufein Flirt Pack for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: rpgsolaflirtpack folder and a setup-rpgsolaflirtpack.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-rpgsolaflirtpack.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-rpgsolaflirtpack.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Solaufein Flirt Pack for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: rpgsolaflirtpack folder, setup-rpgsolaflirtpack and setup-rpgsolaflirtpack.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-rpgsolaflirtpack.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-rpgsolaflirtpack.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Solaufein Flirt Pack for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-rpgsolaflirtpack`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-rpgsolaflirtpack --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
